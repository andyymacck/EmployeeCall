I may expand this program to incorporate some different languages but the idea here is unique enough in my opinion to stand on its own and it functions as it should. '
From alot of other github profiles I see there are some cool projects but they are largely not original ideas and they probably copied them partly from the web already, this is fine. 
I will say I know this is a unique idea because it came to me from working at my on call job that used a system to call employees to either accept or decline offers.
